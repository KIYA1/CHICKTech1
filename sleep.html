  <h2> Reasons Why Sleep Is Good:
<h3>You achieve more in life with sleep than you do if you don't sleep as much.
Many people in the world act way different that they usually do because they are sleepy and it not only effects them but those around them. If you don't get at least 8-9 hours of sleep, you won't function as well as if you got at least 8 hours of sleep.Sleep makes you feel better, but its importance goes way beyond just boosting your mood or banishing under-eye circles. Adequate sleep is a key part of a healthy lifestyle, and can benefit your heart, weight, mind, and more. Sleep plays an important role in your physical health. For example, sleep is involved in healing and repair of your heart and blood vessels. Ongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.Sleep is important to a number of brain functions, including how nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other. In fact, your brain and body stay remarkably active while you sleep. Recent findings suggest that sleep plays a housekeeping role that removes toxins in your brain that build up while you are awake.
